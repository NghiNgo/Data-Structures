VNUHCM-University of Science (VNUHCM-US; formerly known as University of Sciences) has been serving as a pioneer in offering various scientific degrees across Southern Vietnam since its original establishment as the Indochina College of Science in 1941.

VNUHCM-US was re-founded in March 1996 following a split from Đại học Tổng hợp (literally: Ho Chi Minh City University). The school has since been a member university of Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City.

Due to some internal reforms, at the beginning of 1996, the Faculty of Science became the University of Natural Sciences - one of the five affiliated universities of the Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City. In 2007, the University was officially renamed as the University of Science. Since 2007 to present, VNUHCM – US is one of the public universities which plays a particularly important role in offering education and scientific research within VNUHCM system.
